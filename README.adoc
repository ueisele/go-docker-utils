= Go Docker Utility Belt (GoDub)

Goal is to develop a replacement for link:https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-docker-utils/blob/master/confluent/docker_utils/dub.py[Docker Utility Belt] which is written Python.

The _Go Docker Utility Belt_ are written in Go instead to be able to reduce the size of Docker containers.

== Quickstart

_GoDub_ provides a Visual Studio Code Remote Development in Containers set up. 
Just re-open this folder as Remote-Container, and you have a Goland development environment.

Instructions about how to configure Remote Development: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial
